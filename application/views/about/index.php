			<p><a href="http://vesterheim.org/">Vesterheim</a>, like most museums, has many more objects than we can display at one given time. When visitors come to the museum, they see about ten percent of our vast collections of over 24,000 objects. The museum’s three storage facilities house the rest of the collections.</p>
			<p>The exhibition <em>Favorite Things</em>, on view <time datetime="2014-01-23">January 23</time> – <time datetime="2014-04-27">April 27, 2014</time>, is an opportunity for you, the public, to help choose some of the treasured collection pieces from storage to be given the spotlight.</p>
			<p>The 50 items pictured here were nominated by the public last August as worthy of being part of the exhibit. It is now time to decide which ones will go on display. You may vote on each item. A vote of “10” means that the item should definitely be part of the exhibition; a vote of “1” means that it may remain in storage, at least for now! Voting will end on <time datetime="2014-01-10">January 10</time>.  At that time, the items with the highest total will be selected to be part of the exhibition and the results will be posted.</p>
			<p>Thanks for helping design our exhibit!</p>
